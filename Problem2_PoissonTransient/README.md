# Time-dependent heat equation
As a first extension of the previous chapter's Poisson problem, we consider the time-dependent heat equation or the time-dependent diffusion equation. The Poisson equation, which describes the stationary distribution of heat in a body, is naturally extended to a time-dependent problem.
