# Poisson Problem

In this first tutorial we

1.   Present a basic implementation of the finite element solution of Poisson's problem
2.   Import all necessary libraries to solve the problem with the FEniCSx platform
3.   Solve the problem with different grid refinements 
4.   Visualize the solution using Paraview
5.   Perform some postprocessing
