# Scattering of a plane wave by a penetrable circle

This tutorial illustrates how to:

 * Compute the scattering of a plane wave by a homogeneous dielectric obstacle
 * Employ an "absorbing boundary conditions" to truncate the domain
 * Make a nice plot of the solution in the domain
 * Compare the approximation to the analytical solution
