# Scattering of a plane wave by a penetrable circle

This tutorial illustrates how to:
 
 * Solve PDEs with complex-valued fields,
 * Import and use high-order meshes from Gmsh
 * Compute the scattering of a plane wave by a homogeneous dielectric obstacle
 * Employ an "absorbing boundary conditions" to truncate the domain
 * Compare the approximation to the analytical solution
