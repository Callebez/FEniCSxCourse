# Thermo-Elasticity

In this tutorial we will combine two of our previous solvers to model the thermo-elastic deformation of a bimaterial, i.e., a specimen made of two materials with different thermal expansion coefficients. The idea is to solve a problem involving two fields governed by different EDPs, namely, the temperature field $T$ and the displacement field $\mathbf{u}$.
