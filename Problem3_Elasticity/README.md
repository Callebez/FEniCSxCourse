# Linear Elasticity

In this tutorial we

1.   Present an implementation of the finite element discretization of the Navier-Poisson elastostatic problem
2.   Create a non-trivial geometry and impose essential boundary conditions on a vector field
3.   Visualize the solution using Paraview
4.   Perform some postprocessing of the solution.
