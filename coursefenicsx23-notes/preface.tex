The finite element method (FEM) is by now one of the most popular
methods for numerically solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in
science, engineering and applied mathematics. There are a number of
good reasons for this:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[\Smiley] For \textbf{elliptic}
	and \textbf{parabolic} problems\sidenote[][-0.2cm]{\textbf{Elliptic problems}:
		Stationary diffusion,
		heat conduction, fully developed laminar flows in ducts,
		linear elasticity.\\
		\textbf{Parabolic problems}:
		Transient diffusion or heat conduction, chemical kinetics,
		fluid dynamics.},
	the FEM provides very accurate solutions;\\
	
	\item[\Smiley] It is \textbf{general}, not restricted to linear problems,
	or to isotropic problems, or to any subclass of mathematical
	problems; \\
	
	\item[\Smiley] It is \textbf{geometrically flexible}, complex domains
	are quite easily treated, not requiring adaptations of the
	method itself; \\
	
	\item[\Smiley] It is \textbf{easy to code}, and the coding is quite problem-independent.
	Boundary conditions are much easier to deal with than in other methods; \\
	
	\item[\Smiley] It is \textbf{robust}, because in most cases the mathematical problem
	has an underlying variational structure (energy minimization, for example). \\

\section{What This Course Covers}
\labsec{does}

The main objective of this course is to introduce the student to the \href{https://fenicsproject.org/}{\texttt{FEniCSx}} open source platform for solving PDEs using the Finite Element method, through practical examples that arise in Solid and Fluid Mechanics.
The \texttt{FEniCS} project is a high-end open source platform that allows you to efficiently automate the resolution of partial differential equations (PDEs) by the finite element method (FEM). Through the use of a domain-specific language called UFL (Uniform Form Language) it is possible to write the variational formulation of complex problems governed by PDEs and their discretization by the FEM. Despite using a high-level language, the library allows solving problems efficiently with parallel computing, since it generates code in C that is compiled at runtime to perform the assembly of matrices and vectors that arise when applying the method. 

The course essentially consists of practical lectures on how to use the software to 
numerically solve some relevant 2nd order PDEs of interest in fluid and solid mechanics.  
Although the main focus of the course is practical (it will be a hands-on course), some mathematical and theoretical aspects will be recalled so as to provide the necessary context to understand the physical/mathematical problems considered and their numerical resolution by the finite element method. The target audience for the course is primarily graduate students, however, advanced undergrads in applied mathematics, physics or engineering courses are welcome to take the course. Students are expected to have minimal knowledge about PDEs and the physical models behind the problems to be solved. Some previous background about discretization methods for PDEs is also desirable.

The course will be divided into 5 lectures with the following topics to be covered:
